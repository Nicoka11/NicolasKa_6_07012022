# Open Classrooms - project 6

## Description

I'm using Sveltekit for this project because it suited the accesibility requirements very well, and the structure of this project made it logicalto use a Javascript Framework such as SvelteKit.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```
